# Task 00 - Setup
For this year's ERFA OPA session, the baseline of the tasks will all be executed in the web-portal of open-policy-agent!

In case you aren't familiar, have a look https://play.openpolicyagent.org/ 

There will be under the section [04_extended_tasks](../04_extended_tasks/README.md) further exercise which include a locally run open-policy-agent. But the main focus will be on the first 3 exercises concerning RBAC, ABAC, PBAC.

Each exercise will provide a custom pre-built open-policy-agent playground link, where both DATA and INPUT will already be prepared. Your job is to create the policy :).
Note that you can use print() statements which are printed to the f12-console.

If you are familiar with the playground, let's get started with [exercise number 1](../01_rbac/README.md).
