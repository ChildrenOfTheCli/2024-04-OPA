## Explanation
The target of the task 1-1 exercise is to find whether an actual user exists in the data-store with the same Id as the requester.

This can be achieved either by using the `some` keyword, or the `_` placeholder. Experiment with the solution and try to understand it, or maybe even find a better way to do it ;).

## Task 1.2 - solution

## Explanation
Here, we're using the same `_` keyword, but on the policies-section of the data, instead of the customers.
